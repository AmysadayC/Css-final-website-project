        This page is about my opinion about Brians music. I was in love with the song "Fear Of The Water" because I have a really deep, scared connection to oceans. They're both beautiful and at thesame time (for me) scary. The song to me captures the battle between the desire for a deep connection, fighting with the paralyzing fear that comes with risk emotionally, using the imagery of water to bring the overwhelming feeling. For me, this song means showing vulnerability and lets you hear a lot of emotional depth
